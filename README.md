## üåü Features

### 1. Contrastive CoT Prompting
Utilize contrastive prompts to enhance the performance of language models through the Contrastive CoT Prompting technique.

### 2. Role-Playing Prompting
Engage in role-playing prompt generation for better understanding and evaluation of Language Model outputs.

### 3. Self-Consistency Prompting
Implement self-consistency prompts to evaluate the consistency and reliability of Language Model responses.

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting
Explore few-shot prompting methods to improve the ability of Language Models to generalize with limited examples.

### 5. Zero-Shot Prompting
Enhance zero-shot capabilities through specialized prompting approaches to enable Language Models to perform tasks without specific training.

## üöÄ Get Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers

### Installation
```
pip install prompt-eval-llm-judge
```

### Usage
1. Import the necessary modules.
```python
from prompt_eval_llm_judge import CoTPrompt, RolePlayingPrompt
```
2. Create prompts using different techniques.
```python
cot_prompt = CoTPrompt("positive", "negative")
role_playing_prompt = RolePlayingPrompt("character name", "scenario")
```
3. Evaluate Language Model outputs using the generated prompts.
